## Hello World

Welcome to my blog! I'm Eetu Rönkkö, and I'm excited to share my thoughts and ideas with you. I'm a software developer, and I love to write about technology, programming, and other topics that interest me. I hope you enjoy reading my blog posts, and I look forward to hearing your feedback!

## Bit more about me

I'm a software developer based in Helsinki, Finland. I have a passion for technology and programming, and I love to learn new things and share my knowledge with others. I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow as a developer, and I'm excited to see where my career takes me.

## Technologies I work with

I mainly work with React and Next.js but lately i've expanded my knowledge to other technologies as well. I'm always looking for new tools and frameworks to try out, and I love to experiment with different technologies to see what works best for me. Currently i have been using a lot of svelte-kit and i'm really enjoying it. I will most definitely write a blog post about it in the future.
